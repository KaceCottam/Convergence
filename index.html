<li>Deck for inventory</li>
</ul>
<p>CARD TEXT:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown">Carry weight is modified by perks.

Every item has a card with a carry amount. This includes all armor, weapons,
items, and even things a character is carrying temporarily such as
tables for cover or bodies.

If what you are carrying is bigger than your carry weight, you get disadvantages
in every action that requires a roll.

Each character has an inventory which is made of a stack of cards. In Roll20,
there is a decks tab that players could make decks with.</code></pre></div>

abilities. If you try and go into a negative speed value, you tumble and are at
a disadvantage until you get up.</code></pre></div>
