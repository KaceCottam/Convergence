  - Acrobatics Action

CARD TEXT:

```md
You can make acrobatic moves at the cost of (1d4)/4 % of your speed value,
such as making a combat roll to have your weapon ready. You can have
advantage/disadvantage based on if you can convince the dm + inherent character
abilities. If you try and go into a negative speed value, you tumble and are at
a disadvantage until you get up.
```
