## Inventory/Card-Stack

CREATED: Kace (Sat Sep 28 01:09:16 PDT 2019)

ADDS:

  - Carry weight
  - Deck for inventory

CARD TEXT:

```md
Carry weight is modified by perks.

Every item has a card with a carry amount. This includes all armor, weapons,
items, and even things a character is carrying temporarily such as
tables for cover or bodies.

If what you are carrying is bigger than your carry weight, you get disadvantages
in every action that requires a roll.

Each character has an inventory which is made of a stack of cards. In Roll20,
there is a decks tab that players could make decks with.

```
